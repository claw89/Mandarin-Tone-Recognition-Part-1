## Mandarin-Tone-Recognition

Two Jupyter notebooks detailing an attempt to classify the tones of a Mandarin Chinese utterance based on the audio spectrogram. 
Part 1 uses a manual extraction of fetures from extracted tone lines, and part 2 applies the full spectrogram as the input of a 
convolutional neural network.
